## 🛍️ Shopping Data Analysis with MySQL
This project analyzes a shopping dataset to uncover customer behavior, segment user types, identify bestselling products by season, and explore top-performing locations. It's a part of my **Data Analyst portfolio**, focusing on business insights using MySQL.

### 📂 Project Structure
The structure contains:
1) 📊 Dataset
   
The source of dataset used for my analysis is a flat csv file coming from Kaggle webiste 🔗 (https://shorturl.at/8IYdi)

This dataset contains customer-level shopping records, including e.g:
- Gender, Age, Category, Purchase Amount
- Season, Payment Method, Location

2) 🛠️ SQL Analysis

Here you can find few different sql files:
- one file with some DDL commands helping me to normalize new created database (`database_preparation.sql`)
- few separated files with direct customer-linked or product-linked analysis (e.g. `customer_behavior.sql`, `bestsellers_by_season.sql`). During analysis, I tried to use advanced statements or funcions like **CASE**, **Common Table Expression (CTE)** and **Window funcions**

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies used for the project
- **Excel** – used in initial data checks, before creating new schema with tables in SQL.  
- **MySQL** – for querying and analysis
- **DBeaver** – as the SQL client for executing and visualizing queries
- **GitHub** – for version control and publishing


### 📌 Key Objectives

- Prepare raw shopping data for analysis, using SQL   
- Segment customers based on their behavior and demographics  
- Identify seasonal product trends  
- Analyze locations with the highest purchase activity  
- Derive actionable business insights for marketing and sales purpose


### 📈 Future Improvements

- Add dashboards using Power BI or Tableau  
- Automate SQL analysis with stored procedures  
- Build a live reporting pipeline or data app for insights delivery
